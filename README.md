# YOLOv8-Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
This repository demonstrates how to use the YOLOv8 object detection model from Ultralytics for real-time video processing. It includes a Python script that leverages OpenCV and CvZone to detect and annotate objects in video frames with bounding boxes, class names, and confidence scores. The processed video is saved for further analysis.
